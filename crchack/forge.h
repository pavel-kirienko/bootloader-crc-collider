/*
 * Forge a linear checksum by modifying specified bits of an input message.
 *
 * +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 * | DISCLAIMER: Outdated documentation! Complete rewrite coming soon...    |
 * +------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 *
 * `H(msg, length, out)` is a caller-defined checksum function which shall be
 * applied to the input message. It must satisfy a "weak" linearity property:
 *      +-----------------------------------------------------+
 *      | H(x ^ y ^ z) = H(x) ^ H(y) ^ H(z)  for |x|=|y|=|z|. |
 *      +-----------------------------------------------------+
 * For example, all commonly used and standardized CRC functions are supported
 * because CRC(x ^ y ^ z) = CRC(x) ^ CRC(y) ^ CRC(z) holds. As an optimization,
 * forge() calls H(NULL, pos, x) to compute checksum of the message with bit at
 * position `pos` inverted. If H does not implement optimization for the case,
 * then the return value must be 0. Otherwise 1 is returned on successful calls.
 * NOTE: The described optimization is mandatory in the current version!
 *
 * Array bits[] (of `bits_size` elements) specifies indices of mutable bits in
 * the input message. The first bytes are indexed at positions 0, 8, 16... and
 * the bits within a byte are numbered from the LSB to MSB (e.g., the index 10
 * corresponds to the third least significant bit of the second byte).
 *
 * Output buffer `out` receives a modified message with the desired checksum.
 * The passed in buffer must have at least `length` bytes of space.
 *
 * On success, the return value is the number of bits that have been flipped in
 * the modified message `out` in order to obtain the desired checksum (indices
 * of the flipped bits are moved to the beginning of the `bits` array). A return
 * value less than `-checksum->bits` indicates a memory allocation error, while
 * larger values represent the number of additional mutable bits needed to make
 * the forging successful (assuming `H` is a valid weak-linear function).
